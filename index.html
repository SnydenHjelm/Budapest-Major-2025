            <h2>StarLadder are BACK!</h2>
            <p>
                After a hiatus of hosting events since the dawn of partner leagues and the Russian invation of Ukraine,
                legendary TO StarLadder are back! Budapest will play host to StarLadders second CS major, the last being in 
                Berlin in 2019 when Astralis emerged victorious and semented their era. <br>The CS landscape has changed. Astralis
                are no longer kings. Old legends have hanged up the mouse, while new legends have broke onto the scene. Them all
                will battle it out in Hungary's capital. Three weeks straight of top-class CS starting this November. All with one common goal:<br>
                The Major Trophy. To etch their name into the history of Counter-Strike.
                <br><br>
